In particular, what we are going to study is the Higgs decay into two tau ($\\tau$) leptons. Along with the electron and muon, the tau is the third lepton, and was discovered in 1975. Similar to the other two, it comes in positive and negative charges, has spin 1/2, and only interacts via the electroweak forces. However, it is much heavier than the other two, 170 times as heavy as the muon and 3500 times as heavy as the electron, meaning that it is almost twice as heavy as a proton. As a result, its lifetime is very short, about $3\\times 10^{\u221213}$ s, or about 8 million times shorter than that for the muon.\n", "\n", "By correctly measuring and accounting for the total transverse momentum of the two tau particles (the component of their momentum perpendicular to the beam direction), we can reconstruct the Higgs mass. However, the short tau lifetime means that it cannot be detected directly, but can only be reconstructed from its decay products. One difficulty in this reconstruction is that some decay products of tau particles are neutrinos. These are not detectable due to their negligibly small interaction probability and, therefore, their momentum cannot be measured. Machine learning will help us accurately reconstruct the momentum of the tau particles and thereby help us constrain the Higgs mass.\n", "\n", "In the following sections, we will do the following:\n", "\n", "- First, we will describe the Higgs decay products and identify the decay to taus as an important channel.\n", "\n", "- Then, we will use regression analysis to improve our tau momentum reconstruction.\n", "\n", "- Next, we will work towards reconstructing the Higgs mass from our improved tau information.\n", "\n", "- When we have a setup that seems to be able to reconstruct the Higgs mass, the final challenge will be to use all the information we have in our event to do the best possible reconstruction.
